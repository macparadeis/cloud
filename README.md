# Tarpaulin Course Management Tool

<b><h2>Introduction</h2></b>
This is a cloud based course management application that I created for my portfolio project in the Cloud Application Development course at Oregon State University in the Spring of 2025. It demonstrates a RESTful API that manages students, courses, instructors, administrators, and enrollment. It is built with Python and Flask, and utilizes Auth0 to assign, validate, and manage JWTs. The project is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and relies on the Google App Engine and Datastore.
The API Specifications can be found [here](https://github.com/macparadeis/cloud/blob/main/API%20Spec.pdf).
